# General Guidelines for Copilot Usage

This document outlines the guidelines for using GitHub Copilot effectively within this project. Adhering to these guidelines will help maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase.

## Commenting and Documentation

- Always write clear and concise comments for any code generated or suggested by Copilot.
- Ensure that comments accurately describe the functionality and purpose of the code.
- Avoid redundant comments that do not add value or clarity to the code.
- Use English for all comments and documentation to maintain consistency.

## Code Quality and Consistency

- Review and test all code generated by Copilot to ensure it meets the project's coding standards and requirements.
- Refactor any Copilot-generated code that does not align with the established code style or best practices.
- Ensure that Copilot suggestions do not introduce security vulnerabilities or performance issues.
- Maintain consistency in naming conventions, formatting, and structure as per the project's coding guidelines.

## General structure of the Project

- The Node.js backend code is located in the `src` directory.
- The views/templates are located in the `src/views` directory.
- The routes are defined in the `src/routes` directory. Never have HTML as code in the routes files. Use ejs views instead.
- The controllers are located in the `src/controllers` directory. Refactor business logic into controllers instead of having it in routes.
- The models are located in the `src/models` directory.
- Configuration files are located in the `config` directory.
- Middleware functions are located in the `src/middleware` directory.
- The frontend code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, is located in the `public` directory.
- Utility functions should be organized in dedicated files within the `public/js/utilities` directory for better modularity and reusability.
